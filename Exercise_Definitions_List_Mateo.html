	<dl>
		<dt><b><font size = "5">ADAPTIVE SOFTWARE</font></b></dt>
			<dd><ul><li>is specialized software designed for physically challenged users. This software usually runs on specialized hardware. This term is also known as assistive software.</li></ul></dd>
		<dt><b><font size = "5">BACKUP SOFTWARE</font></b></dt>
			<dd><ul><li>is any application that enables the backup of files, folders, documents, software data, most data types and the computer/server as a whole. Backup software enables the creation of an exact duplicate of computer files that can be used for restoring the original files in case of file corruption, accidental/intentional deletion or a disaster.</li></ul></dd>
		<dt><b><font size = "5">CACHE MEMORY</font></b></dt>
			<dd><ul><li> is a small-sized type of volatile computer memory that provides high-speed data access to a processor and stores frequently used computer programs, applications and data.</li></ul></dd>
		<dt><b><font size = "5">DATA CORRUPTION</font></b></dt>
			<dd><ul><li>is a when data becomes unusable, unreadable or in some other way inaccessible to a user or application. Data corruption occurs when a data element or instance loses its base integrity and transforms into a form that is not meaningful for the user or the application accessing it.</li></ul></dd>
		<dt><b><font size = "5">THE ELECTRONIC NUMERICAL INTEGRATOR AND COMPUTER (ENIAC)</font></b></dt>
			<dd><ul><li>was the very first general-purpose electronic computer. It was designed primarily to calculate artillery firing tables to be used by the United States Army's Ballistic Research Laboratory to help US troops during World War II. The artillery firing tables helped to predict where an artillery shell would hit, allowing troops to hit their targets more precisely or evade incoming shells. The first programs written for the ENIAC included a study of the hydrogen bomb's feasibility.</li></ul></dd>
		<dt><b><font size = "5">FIEBR OPTIC</font></b></dt>
			<dd><ul><li> refers to the technology and medium used in the transmission of data as pulses of light through a strand or fiber medium made of glass or plastic (optical fiber), versus being sent as electrical pulses through conductive metal, like copper wires. Optical fiber technology can carry much more data than conventional copper wires and is less prone to electromagnetic interference, simply because data is transmitted in the form of light, rather than electricity.</li></ul></dd>
		
		<dt><b><font size = "5">GIGAHERTz (GHz) </font></b></dt>
		<dd><ul><li> is a frequency unit that measures the number of cycles per second. Hertz (Hz) refers to the number of cycles per second with periodic 1-second intervals. One megahertz (MHz) equals 1,000,000 Hz. One gigahertz is equal to 1,000 megahertz (MHz) or 1,000,000,000 Hz.</li></ul></dd>
		
		<dt><b><font size = "5">HARD REBOOT</font></b></dt>
			<dd><ul><li> is the process of restarting a computer manually, physically or using any other method besides restarting it from the operating system controls. This allows a user to restart a computer, which is usually done when the operating system or software functions are not responding. A hard reboot may also be called a hard restart, cold reboot or cold restart.</li></ul></dd>
		<dt><b><font size = "5">IMPLEMENTATION</font></b></dt>
			<dd><ul><li>In Java, an interface or the abstract type used to denote an interface must be implemented by classes. The interfaces that a certain class implements determine whether various aspects of these classes are "known" by another class, or what kinds of knowledge one class has about another.</li></ul></dd>
		<dt><b><font size = "5">JAILBREAK</font></b></dt>
			<dd><ul><li> refers to the process of gaining root access to the iOS operating system that runs on Apple devices, including the iPad, iPhone and iPod Touch. Jailbreaking frees the device from dependence on Apple as the exclusive source of applications, allowing users to install third-party apps unavailable at the official App Store. Users can also customize their home screens and modify the appearance of icons and menus. Jailbreaking is sometimes a prelude to unlocking an iPhone or modifying its baseband so that the unit can work with other mobile networks. Jailbreak may also be known as jailbreaking or iOS jailbreak.</li></ul></dd>
		<dt><b><font size = "5">KEYWORD</font></b></dt>
			<dd><ul><li>in the context of search engine optimization, is a particular word or phrase that describes the contents of a Web page. Keywords are intended to act as shortcuts that sum up an entire page. Keywords form part of a Web page’s metadata and help search engines match a page to with an appropriate search query.</li></ul></dd>
		<dt><b><font size = "5">LIGHT-EMITTING DIODE DISPLAY (LED DISPLAY)</font></b></dt>
			<dd><ul><li>is a screen display technology that uses a panel of LEDs as the light source. Currently, a large number of electronic devices, both small and large, use LED display as a screen and as an interaction medium between the user and the system. Modern electronic devices such as mobile phones, TVs, tablets, computer monitors, laptops screens, etc., use a LED display to display their output.</li></ul></dd>
		<dt><b><font size = "5">MACHINE INTELLIGENCE</font></b></dt>
			<dd><ul><li> is a somewhat obscure term for specific kinds of artificial intelligence that are being noticing as the field advances. A definition put forth by some artificial intelligence companies is that machine intelligence “enables a machine to interact with an environment in an intelligent way.”</li></ul></dd>
		<dt><b><font size = "5">NETWORK ADAPTER</font></b></dt>
			<dd><ul><li>is usually the only component within a computer for interfacing or connecting with a network. Typically, it is built on a printed circuit board with jumpers that connect it with the computer’s motherboard. A network adapter for wired networks has an RJ-45 port that uses twisted or untwisted pair cable for network connectivity. Wireless adapters connect with the network through a built-in or externally connected antenna. Both network adapters support popular LAN protocols such as TCP/IP.</li></ul></dd>
		<dt><b><font size = "5">OBJECT-ORIENTED</font></b></dt>
			<dd><ul><li>is a computer science concept that has been widely implemented, specifically in programming languages and applications/software. The object-oriented technique is different from conventional programming, which focuses on functions/behaviors, while object-oriented works on the interactions of one or more objects.</li></ul></dd>
		<dt><b><font size = "5">PAGING</font></b></dt>
			<dd><ul><li>an be important in memory storage for hardware systems because it allows more versatility than some traditional processes.</li></ul></dd>
		<dt><b><font size = "5">QUANTIFIERS</font></b></dt>
			<dd><ul><li>are used in quantified expressions in which the free variables are bound by the quantifiers. In other words, the variables of the predicates are quantified by quantifiers. There are two well-known quantifiers used in predicate logic: the universal quantifier and the existential quantifier.</li></ul></dd>
		<dt><b><font size = "5">REFRESH RATE</font></b></dt>
			<dd><ul><li>is a common figure used to gauge a computer monitor's or device screen's ability to effectively display the graphical and textual display output. It can be controlled using a compatible video/display card.</li></ul></dd>
		<dt><b><font size = "5">SECURE CODING</font></b></dt>
			<dd><ul><li>is the practice of writing a source code or a code base that is compatible with the best security principles for a given system and interface.</li></ul></dd>
